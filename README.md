# Office 365 Group Sync Utility

[Git Repo](https://github.com/nathancrjackson/ps-o365-group-sync)

Unlike earlier types of groups the new Office 365 group type does not allow for nested group membership. While the Office 365 group type is still powerful in it's own right (with features like dynamic membership) you might want emulate a more traditional style of managing group membership.

## Description

This utility takes in which users and groups are mapped to your Office 365 group (defined in a JSON format), compiles those mappings into a flat user membership list and compares that list to the current membership of the Office 365 group. If you choose to the script can then update the current membership to match the generated membership.

## Configuration

**There is an example config file in the example folder**

Definition of the config file JSON:  

```
{
	"TenantPrefix" : STRING*,
	"GlobalGroups" : ARRAY OF STRINGS,
	"GlobalUsers" : ARRAY OF STRINGS
	"Mappings" : ARRAY OF MAPPINGOBJECTS*
}
```
(* = required)

Definition of MappingObject:  

```
{
	"Parent": STRING*,
	"ChildGroups" : ARRAY OF STRINGS,
	"ChildUsers" : ARRAY OF STRINGS
}
```
(* = required)



```
TenantPrefix
```

*Required*

The prefix for your onmicrosoft.com domain. For example if you have contoso.onmicrosoft.com the tenant prefix would be: contoso

When you are logged into the Azure AD this is used to check that you are connected to the correct tenant.

```
GlobalGroups
```

This is an array of groups that are members of every group mapped by this utility.

```
GlobalUsers
```

This is an array of users that are members of every group mapped by this utility.

```
Mappings
```

*Required*

This is an array of MappingObjects. This dictates which groups are managed by this utility and how those groups members are defined.

```
Parent
```

*Required*

This is the name of the group being managed.

```
ChildGroups
```

This is an array of groups that are members of the parent group.


```
ChildUsers
```

This is an array of users that are members of the parent group.

## Examples

**Example 1: Interactive run that autofills username in Microsoft login popup and after it displays changes gives you a prompt to commit changes**

```
& '.\Office365 Group Sync.ps1' -username "sysadmin@contoso.com" -commit "prompt"
```

*Note: If you are already connected with a different user it will use that connection to the Azure AD provided it is for the correct tenant. If you are already authenticated with the specified username but not connected with it the Microsoft login popup will be skipped and you will automatically connect.*

**Example 2: Non-interactive run that logs in with username and password then automatically commits changes**

```
& '.\Office365 Group Sync.ps1' -username "sysadmin@contoso.com" -password "1FastGate!" -commit "yes"
```

*Note: If you are already connected with a different user it will use that connection to the Azure AD provided it is for the correct tenant.*

## Possible future features

The following is a list of possible features in future updates:
- Checks to ensure current user can make changes to group memberships.
- Support for Azure Contexts.
- New parameter -ForceNonInteractive to ensure utility won't halt when run as a task.
- New parameter -Reconnect to force reconnection each time script run. Currently the script will use current authentication before trying provided credentials. Provided -Disconnect is $TRUE and you let the script finish this is already done.
- Deny Groups and Users at both the Global and Child level.
